# 📁 FILE UPLOAD NOW REQUIRED FOR ALL CONTENT TYPES - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 Summary

I've successfully updated the training material forms to **require file uploads for ALL content types**. No training materials can now be saved without adding files, ensuring complete content delivery.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **✅ Modal Form (AddEditTrainingForm.jsx)**

#### **File Validation Logic Updated:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only required for Video/PDF/Guide
if ((current.type === 'Video' || current.type === 'PDF' || current.type === 'Guide') && !file && !editingMaterial) {
  return 'File is required for this content type';
}

// AFTER: Required for ALL content types  
if (!file && !editingMaterial) {
  return 'File is required for all content types';
}
```

#### **Supported File Types Expanded:**
- **Article**: Images + PDFs (was images only)
- **FAQ**: Images + PDFs (new support)  
- **Video**: Video files (unchanged)
- **PDF**: PDF files (unchanged)
- **Guide**: Images + PDFs (unchanged)

#### **UI Changes:**
- ✅ **File upload section now visible for ALL content types** (was hidden for Articles)
- ✅ **Required asterisk (*) always shown** on file upload label
- ✅ **Updated error messages** to reflect new requirement
- ✅ **Enhanced file type validation** for all content types

### **✅ Page Form (AddEditTraining.jsx)**

#### **Alternative Validation Logic:**
```javascript
// Updated to allow either file OR external link for page form
if (!selectedFile && !formData.uploadLink.trim()) {
  newErrors.file = 'Either a file upload or external link is required';
  alertErrors.push('Either a file upload or external link is required.');
}
```
