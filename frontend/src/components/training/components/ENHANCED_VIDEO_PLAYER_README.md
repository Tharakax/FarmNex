## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Picture-in-Picture Not Working
1. **Check Browser Support** - Ensure you're using a supported browser
2. **HTTPS Required** - PiP requires HTTPS in production
3. **User Gesture** - PiP must be triggered by user interaction
4. **Video Must Be Playing** - PiP only works when video is actively playing

### Video Not Loading
1. **Check Video URL** - Ensure the video file exists
2. **File Format** - MP4 format is recommended for best compatibility
3. **CORS Issues** - Ensure proper CORS headers for cross-origin videos

### Performance Issues
1. **Large Video Files** - Consider video compression for better performance
2. **Multiple Videos** - Only one PiP video can be active at a time
3. **Browser Resources** - Close other tabs if experiencing lag
