- **Best for**: Homepage integration, dedicated training pages
- **Features**: Statistics, highlights, call-to-action buttons

## ðŸ”§ Integration Options

### Option 1: Homepage Integration
Add the training section to your homepage without modifying the original file:

```jsx
// In any page component
import TrainingNavSection from '../components/TrainingNavSection';

// Add anywhere in your JSX:
<TrainingNavSection />
```

### Option 2: Enhanced Navbar Dropdown
Replace the simple training link with an enhanced dropdown:

```jsx
// In navigation.jsx (replace the existing training NavLink)
import TrainingQuickAccess from './TrainingQuickAccess';

// Replace this:
<NavLink to="/training">Training</NavLink>

// With this:
<TrainingQuickAccess />
```

### Option 3: Dedicated Training Page
The TrainingShowcase page is already routed at `/training-showcase` and ready to use.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Steps

1. **For Homepage Enhancement:**
   ```jsx
   // In homePage.jsx, add after imports:
   import TrainingNavSection from '../components/TrainingNavSection';
   
   // Add between any existing sections:
   <TrainingNavSection />
   ```

2. **For Enhanced Navigation:**
   ```jsx
   // In navigation.jsx, add after imports:
   import TrainingQuickAccess from './TrainingQuickAccess';
   
   // Replace the training NavLink with:
