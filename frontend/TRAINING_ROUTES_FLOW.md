# 🚀 Training System - Routes & Flow

## How Training Files Work in Your Application

Based on your `App.jsx` and file structure, here's exactly how your training system works:

---

## 🛣️ **Route Structure**

Your training system has these main routes:

```javascript
// PUBLIC ROUTES (Anyone can access)
/training                    → TrainingShowcase.jsx (Public showcase)
/training/:id               → PublicTrainingViewer.jsx (View specific training)
/training-showcase          → TrainingShowcase.jsx (Alternative route)

// ADMIN/MANAGEMENT ROUTES (Requires login)
/training-home              → TrainingHomePage.jsx (Admin dashboard)
/add                        → AddEditTraining.jsx (Create new training)
/edit/:id                   → AddEditTraining.jsx (Edit existing training)
/view/:id                   → ViewTraining.jsx (Admin view training)

// DASHBOARD ACCESS
/farmer-dashboard           → FarmerDashboard.jsx
    └── Training section   → TrainingManagementFull.jsx (Legacy full management)
```

// Usage in homepage
<PublishedTrainingSection />
    └── Fetches published trainings from API
    └── Displays featured training cards
    └── Links to /training/{id} for each training
```

### **Example 2: Dashboard Integration**
```javascript
// In FarmerDashboard.jsx (Lines 104-109)
const TrainingManagementFull = React.lazy(() => 
  import('../components/training/legacy/TrainingManagementFull')
);

// When "Training" is clicked in sidebar:
case 'Training':
  return <TrainingManagementFull />;
      └── Full admin interface with all management features
      └── Statistics, material list, bulk operations
      └── Create, edit, delete functionality
```

### **Example 3: API Service Layer**

├── trainingAPIReal.getStatistics() // Dashboard stats
└── trainingAPIReal.deleteTrainingMaterial(id) // Delete training

AddEditTraining.jsx:
├── trainingAPIReal.getTrainingMaterial(id) // Load for editing
