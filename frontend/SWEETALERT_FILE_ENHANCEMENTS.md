# 🍭 SWEETALERT FILE REQUIREMENTS - COMPLETE INTEGRATION!

## 🎯 Summary

I've successfully integrated comprehensive **SweetAlert notifications** for all file-related interactions in both training material forms. Users now get professional, interactive alerts for file requirements, confirmations, warnings, and success messages.

## 🎪 Complete SweetAlert Integration

### **✅ File Requirement Enforcement**

#### **🚫 Hard-Stop for Missing Files:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Regular validation in form submission
if (!selectedFile && !editingMaterial) {
  return 'File is required for all content types';
}

// AFTER: Immediate SweetAlert popup before other validations
if (!selectedFile && !editingMaterial) {
  showValidationError(['File is required for all content types.'], 'File Required');
  return; // Stops submission immediately
}
```

#### **💡 What Users See:**
- **Modal Form**: Dedicated "File Required" SweetAlert before other validations
- **Page Form**: Same dedicated file requirement check
- **Clear Message**: "File is required for all content types"
- **Professional Design**: Consistent with existing validation style

### **✅ File Interaction Confirmations**

#### **🗑️ File Removal Confirmation:**
- **Modal Form**: "Remove File" confirmation with SweetAlert
- **Page Form**: Same confirmation system
- **Safety Net**: Prevents accidental file deletion
- **Success Feedback**: "File removed" toast notification

```javascript
const result = await showConfirm(
  'Are you sure you want to remove the selected file?',
  'Remove File'
);
if (result.isConfirmed) {
  // Remove file and show toast
  showToast('File removed', 'info');
}
```

#### **⚠️ Content Type Change Warnings:**
```javascript
if (selectedFile && formData.type !== type.value) {
  const result = await showConfirm(
    `Changing content type may affect file compatibility. Your selected file (${selectedFile.name}) might not be valid for ${type.value} content. Continue?`,
    'Content Type Change Warning'
  );
}
```

### **✅ Enhanced Success Messages**

#### **🎉 File Selection Success:**
- **Detailed File Info**: Shows file name and size
- **Professional Toast**: Success notification with checkmark
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate confirmation of file selection

```javascript
const fileSize = (file.size / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2);
showToast(`✅ File "${file.name}" (${fileSize}MB) selected successfully!`, 'success');
```

#### **📋 Unsaved Changes Warning:**
- **Enhanced Detection**: Includes file in unsaved changes check
- **Specific Messages**: Different messages for forms with/without files
- **File-Aware**: Special message when file is selected but not saved
